# In-Game Editor

The Ingame Editor is a very important tool for you to manage your crates types.

With it you can reload the plugin and edit anything about crates. This allows you to make things much faster and much easier without having to do them manually from a configuration file.

For you to be able to edit all types of crates inside the server you have to execute the command:

> /crate editor

## Menus

* Initially you are encountered by a menu where you will have two options, one of them allows you to reload all plugin settings as main settings, crate types as well as messages and other option allows you to edit/create crates.
