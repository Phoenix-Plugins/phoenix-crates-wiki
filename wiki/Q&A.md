Below are some questions and answers that should help with potential problems that appear.

## Phoenix Plugins does not support my server version

If our plugin does not yet support your server version there is no reason to be upset. This means we have not yet had the opportunity to add support since the plugin is in Beta. If you want the plugin to work on a specified version just join our [discord](LINK_TO) and request that addition!
