# Crates - Change System

All rewards of a crate can have any percentage because what matters is the percentage of each item in the total summed percentage of all items.

This means that if I have 2 items, each with 100% the system will interpret them as 50% each.

The minimum percentage that the system accepts is 1% but there is no need to have less than that since there is no maximum percentage limit so you have any freedom on creating the items you want with any chance to get.

Also you can see all items you added by using the preview mode clicking left on the crate block (assuming that this feature is activated) like can you see in the following image:
