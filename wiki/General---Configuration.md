# Configuration

Phoenix Creator still has some configuration fields allowing you to customize various aspects of the plugin.

## General Configuration

Below is a list of options which are in the **config.yml** and a description of what they do.

- **player-each-time** - This option allows you to define whether one or more players can open the crate at the same time.
- **preview-enabled** - This option allows you to define whether the interaction of the left button on a crate will allow players to see its contents.
- **knockback** - This option allows you to change the knockback that the player takes when trying to open a crate with the wrong key-

## Messages Configuration

The messaging configuration file is pretty self explanatory when it comes to configuration. 

All texts that the player can see are customized in the configuration file for example holograms, chat messages and menus.

One main concept you need to know is a placeholder, they are called like **{this_is_placeholder}**. A placeholder is a character, word, or group of characters that temporarily takes the place of the final data.
